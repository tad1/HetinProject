# HetinProject

Imagine that you have a college assignment to make 2D bullet hell. </br>
To your disposal, you have C++ 14 and SDL2 library. </br> </br>
If you are a lazy and experienced game developer, you definitely will write a game engine first. And then use it for this project. </br>
And it happens that I'm one of these kinds of people.

Let me present Hetin, a game (highly) inspired by [LUFTRAUSERS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233150/LUFTRAUSERS). But you have only one weapon, the physics is woody, and the enemies are twice as dumb.. just play Luftrausers instead.

#### Note:
I abandoned this project after getting a credit.
